✦ This Next.js application is well-suited for deployment on platforms like Vercel and Render because:


   1. Next.js Compatibility: Both Vercel and Render offer first-class support for Next.js applications, automatically detecting the framework
      and configuring the build and deployment processes.
   2. Standard Build Process: The package.json defines a standard \"build\": \"next build\" script, which generates the necessary static
      assets and server-side code in the .next directory. This is the expected output for Next.js deployments.
   3. Existing Deployment Configuration: The presence of deploy/netlify.toml indicates that the project is already configured for a similar
      deployment environment (Netlify). This file specifies command = \"bun run build\" (or next build as per package.json) and publish = 
      \".next\", which are common patterns for deploying Next.js applications.


  Therefore, deploying this project to Vercel or Render would be straightforward, as these platforms are designed to handle Next.js
  projects with minimal configuration.

# make: 这个b学值不值得上。school-calculator, to analyse which school offer is better. 

✦ Okay, I can help you plan the development of a "school-calculator" within your existing Next.js project to analyze school
  offers, along with best practices for SEO and maintenance.


  The core idea is to create a tool that allows users to input various factors for different school offers (e.g., tuition,
  scholarships, living costs, program length, potential post-graduation salary, personal preferences like location or
  program reputation) and then provides a comparative analysis, potentially calculating ROI or a weighted score.

  Here's a plan:

  1. Application Structure & Core Functionality


   * New Page: We'll create a new route for the calculator, likely at /school-calculator. This will involve creating a new
     page.tsx file:
      src/app/[locale]/school-calculator/page.tsx
   * Main Component: A dedicated React component will house the calculator's logic and UI, similar to your
     AdvisorCalculator.tsx:
      src/components/SchoolCalculator.tsx
   * UI Components: We'll leverage your existing src/components/ui (e.g., input.tsx, label.tsx, button.tsx, card.tsx,
     slider.tsx) to maintain consistency.
   * Internationalization (i18n): New text strings for the calculator (labels, descriptions, results) will be added to your
     src/i18n/locales/*.json files.
   * Comparison Logic: The SchoolCalculator.tsx component will manage the state for multiple school entries, perform
     calculations (e.g., net cost, estimated ROI, a customizable weighted score based on user preferences), and display the
     comparative results.

  2. SEO Best Practices


  To ensure your new "school-calculator" page ranks well and is discoverable:


   * Semantic HTML: Use appropriate HTML5 tags (<main>, <section>, <h1>, <p>, etc.) for clear structure and meaning.
   * Meta Tags:
       * Title Tag: A descriptive and keyword-rich <title> (e.g., "School Offer Comparison Calculator | Analyze University
         Admissions").
       * Meta Description: A concise summary of the page's content, encouraging clicks (e.g., "Compare university offers,
         scholarships, and costs to find the best school for your future. Make informed decisions.").
       * Open Graph (OG) & Twitter Cards: Implement og:title, og:description, og:image, twitter:card, etc., in
         src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx or directly in the page.tsx for social media sharing.
   * Friendly URLs: The chosen URL /school-calculator is clean and descriptive.
   * Content Quality: Provide clear, helpful content around the calculator, explaining its purpose and how to use it.
   * Performance: Next.js handles many performance aspects, but ensure efficient component rendering and avoid large,
     unoptimized images.
   * Sitemap: Ensure the new page's URL is included in public/sitemap.xml.
   * Internationalization: Your existing i18n setup is excellent for targeting different language markets.

  3. Maintenance Best Practices

  For long-term maintainability and scalability:


   * Modularity: Break down the SchoolCalculator.tsx into smaller, focused components (e.g., SchoolInputForm.tsx,
     SchoolComparisonTable.tsx, ResultDisplay.tsx).
   * Clear Naming: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and components.
   * TypeScript: Leverage TypeScript for strong typing, which improves code clarity and reduces bugs.
   * Consistent Styling: Adhere to your existing Tailwind CSS conventions.
   * Linting & Formatting: Ensure your new code follows the rules defined in biome.json and eslint.config.mjs.
   * Minimal Comments: Add comments only for complex logic or non-obvious decisions, not for self-explanatory code.
   * Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for user inputs and calculations.
   * Accessibility (A11y): Design with accessibility in mind (e.g., proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).

  Addressing "这个b学值不值得上。" (Is this B school worth attending?)


  This is precisely the kind of question the "school-calculator" aims to help answer. By allowing users to input
  quantitative data (tuition, scholarships, living costs, potential salary) and qualitative factors (program reputation,
  location, personal fit, which can be assigned a numerical weight), the calculator will provide a structured framework to
  compare options and arrive at a more informed decision about whether a particular school (like "B school") is "worth it"
  based on their individual criteria.
