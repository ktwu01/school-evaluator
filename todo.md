- [] Addressing "这个b学值不值得上。" (Is this fxxk school worth attending?)

- [] This is precisely the kind of question the "school-calculator" aims to help answer. 

By allowing users to input
  quantitative data (tuition, scholarships, living costs, potential salary) and qualitative factors (program reputation,
  location, personal fit, which can be assigned a numerical weight), the calculator will provide a structured framework to
  compare options and arrive at a more informed decision about whether a particular school (like "B school") is "worth it"
  based on their individual criteria.

  3. Maintenance Best Practices

  For long-term maintainability and scalability:


   * Modularity: Break down the SchoolCalculator.tsx into smaller, focused components (e.g., SchoolInputForm.tsx,
     SchoolComparisonTable.tsx, ResultDisplay.tsx).
   * Clear Naming: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and components.
   * TypeScript: Leverage TypeScript for strong typing, which improves code clarity and reduces bugs.
   * Consistent Styling: Adhere to your existing Tailwind CSS conventions.
   * Linting & Formatting: Ensure your new code follows the rules defined in biome.json and eslint.config.mjs.
   * Minimal Comments: Add comments only for complex logic or non-obvious decisions, not for self-explanatory code.
   * Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for user inputs and calculations.
   * Accessibility (A11y): Design with accessibility in mind (e.g., proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
